      <h2>what is this???</h2>
      <p>undecided.js is a command line program that runs on top of node.js <br/><br/>If you installed undecided.js previously you can make sure you have the latest version by typing <span class="command">npm update -g undecided</span></p>

      <h2>step 1</h2>
      <p>Check if you have Node.js installed on your system. Use spotlight search (CMD + SPACEBAR) to open an application called terminal. </br></br>In the terminal window, right after the $ sign, type </br><span class="command">node -v</span> then press enter. </br></br>If a number is returned that means you already have Node and you can continue to Step 2. </br></br>If nothing is returned then go to the <a target="_blank" href="https://nodejs.org">Node.js</a> website and install the "Recommended for Most Users" version. Installing Node.js is really easy and only takes a few minutes - it will allow you to use this program as many times as you want!</p>

      <h2>step 3</h2>
      <p>In your terminal window, directly after the $ type </br><span class="command">npm install -g undecided</span> then press enter. You only have to do this once! After the program is installed you can follow steps 4 and 5 as many times as you want. </br></br><i>When typing commands into terminal (highlighted in white)  you always have to press Enter so that the computer knows to actually run the command.</i>  </br></br>If you get some errors that say something like <span class="errors">npm ERR! Error: EACCES</span> you can type in <span class="command">sudo chown -R $USER /usr/local</span> and press enter. Now you can try <span class="command">npm install -g undecided</span> again. </br></br>If you see a huge list of names show up in your terminal window don't freak out this is just your computer installing the tiny programs it needs to run undecided.js - now you can continue to step 4.</p>
